The STRUDEL team hosted an in person hackathon at Berkeley Lab to help scientific teams prototype a web application over a few hours. Attendees learned about the STRUDEL Design System and explored available Task Flows to adapt them to address a development need for their team's software.

Attendees ranged from beamline scientists at the Advanced Light Source, to Research Software Engineers and Open Source Software Researchers. The software they worked on developing ranged from computational analysis systems to searchable data repositories. It was a fun and interactive day with a lot of learning all around. Huge thank you to all the attendees who spent the day with us!
