Have you found building and delivering usable scientific software to be challenging? Are you encountering challenges meeting user needs with the software your team is developing?

Join the STRUDEL project’s upcoming events to learn more about approaches and tools to address these challenges!

The Berkeley Lab Scientific Data Division User Experience (UX) team has launched the Scientific sofTware Research for User experience, Design, Engagement, and Learning (STRUDEL) project to address these pain points. Please join us for the STRUDEL project’s upcoming series of events designed to help support adoption of user experience (UX) approaches in scientific software development. Our first virtual event introduces the STRUDEL project and its products through our team’s journey adopting UX methods in scientific software development. Our second virtual event will help you get started building usable user interfaces (UI) with the STRUDEL Design System. Our third in-person hackathon will provide participants with the opportunity to prototype a new UI using the Design System while receiving expert support from the STRUDEL team.
