Join us for a hackathon focused on the intersection of User Experience (UX) design and science! 
The STRUDEL project is hosting an all day, in-person hackathon on Monday, January 27th, 2025 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA.  

<b>Space is limited, so be sure to register now via the [interest form](https://forms.gle/eVt5oeuxx1FUBUEg9) by January 17th, 2025. We’re excited to see you there!</b>

### Who Should Join

This hackathon is for you if you currently develop software for research purposes and/or you're interested in applying UX principles to transform research tools. While all participants are welcome, this hackathon will be particularly engaging for those who have some coding experience and are looking to work on a specific web app or piece of software.


### Why Join?

This event is an exciting opportunity to collaborate with peers and practitioners while working to improve user experience within the scientific community. Together, we’ll explore how to create intuitive tools and interfaces that can make science and your research process more accessible, efficient, and engaging.

Throughout the day, members of the STRUDEL team will lead a hands-on workshop to help scientific software teams design and implement a prototype user interface. We’ll help you transform one of your project’s feature need into a functioning prototype using user experience design methods and the STRUDEL Design System. If your scientific software team has a problem or feature requiring a new web-based user interface, join us in the hackathon!
