    ## A

    ### <span id="account">Account</span>

    Record of a user in the system, which may include permissions, roles, and internal
    records of history of actions.

    ### <span id="analysis">Analysis</span>

    Category of <Link to="#task-flow">Task Flow</Link> that involves intensive
    computation.

    ## C

    ### <span id="computation">Computation</span>

    Backend computation that runs in non-interactive (e.g. 10 sec or more) time.

    ## D

    ### <span id="data">Data</span>

    One data entity. May be scalar, vector, matrix, or have an irregular structure of
    potentially nested fields and values.

    ### <span id="data-management">Data management</span>

    Category of <Link to="#Task-flow">Task Flow</Link> that involves movement or other
    bulk operations on datasets.

    ### <span id="design-system">Design System</span>

    A Design System is a set of reusable components and patterns along with guidelines for designing and implementing user interfaces in science and research domains.

    See <Link to="/design-system">this page for details on the STRUDEL Design System</Link>.

    ## E

    ### <span id="exploration">Exploration</span>

    Category of <Link to="#task-flow">Task Flow</Link> that involves searching or
    browsing to retrieve data as well as examining data items in detail.

    ## F

    ### <span id="flowsheet">Flowsheet</span>

    In process engineering, the set of process units and the "streams" that connect them
    into a graph.

    ## I

    ### <span id="interactive-computation">Interactive computation</span>

    Backend computation that runs in interactive (e.g. 10 sec or less) time.

    ## P

    ### <span id="planning-framework">Planning Framework</span>

    A Planning Framework is a set of guides and questions that will help scientific teams incorporate UX practices in their software production.

    See <Link to="/planning-framework">this page for details about the STRUDEL Planning Framework</Link>.

    ### <span id="profile">Profile</span>

    Information about a user in the system that typically comes from the user

    ## S

    ### <span id="scenario">Scenario</span>

    A selection of a model and parameters used as input to a computation.

    ## T

    ### <span id="task-flow">Task Flow</span>

    A set of steps (represented by a series of screens) that help to accomplish a task
    and represent how a user progresses through a UI. A series of Task Flows can be composed into the GUI of a <Link to="#workflow">Workflow</Link>.

    ## U

    ### <span id="user">User</span>

    Uniquely identified actor in the system

    ### <span id="utility">Utility</span>

    category.

    ## W

    ### <span id="workflow">Workflow</span>

    A series of steps to complete a research goal, such as: data collection through experiments and observations, data movement over a wide area network, running simulations and data analyses on desktops or large-scale computing systems. Workflows are typically computationally represented from a computer science perspective as Graphs or Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
