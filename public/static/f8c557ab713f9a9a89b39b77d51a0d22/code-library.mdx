  ## Getting Started with STRUDEL Kit

  The best way to get started building is using the STRUDEL CLI, a simple command-line tool to help you scaffold a web application based on the STRUDEL Design System and its supported task flows.

  [See the STRUDEL CLI docs on GitHub to get started](https://github.com/strudel-science/strudel-kit/blob/main/strudel-cli/README.md).

  Detailed tutorials and guides for STRUDEL Kit are coming soon!
